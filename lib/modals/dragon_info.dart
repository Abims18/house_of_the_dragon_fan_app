    "Balerion, known as the Black Dread, was ridden by Aegon the Conquerer as he took control of the Seven Kingdoms. Viserys I Targaryen was his rider until the dragon's passing. The last surviving creature from Valyria, it is rumored that he was so large his shadow could swallow an entire town when he took flight.",
    "Caraxes, nicknamed the Blood Wyrm, is ridden by Daemon Targaryen. He is a formidable, lean dragon with blood-red scales.",
    "Seasmoke is a pale, silver-gray dragon. Still a young dragon, he is very nimble in the air.",
    "Syrax, ridden by Rhaenyra Targaryen, is named after a goddess of Valyria. She is a young dragon with yellow scales and is not yet as forbidding as her counterparts."
